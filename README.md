A cross-platform EDL (Emergency Download) flashing tool for OPLUS (OPPO/OnePlus/Realme) devices, built with Avalonia UI.

## What's New in v2

v2 is a complete rewrite with the following improvements:

- **New UI Framework**: Migrated from WPF to **Avalonia UI**
- **Better Architecture**: Cleaner codebase with improved maintainability
- **Improved Performance**: Faster partition parsing and flashing operations
- **Native AOT Compilation**: Single-file deployment, no .NET runtime required, faster startup

## Features

- **Enter Firehose Mode**: Load device programmer (devprg*.mbn) with digest and signature files
- **Flash ROM Packages**: Support for extracted ROM folders, OFP and OPS encrypted packages
- **Partition Management**: 
  - Read partition table from device
  - Read/Write/Erase individual partitions
  - Batch flash selected partitions
- **Super Partition Support**: Automatic merge of segmented super images (super.0.xxx.img, super.1.xxx.img, etc.), supports merging based on super_def.00000000.json definition
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Chinese interface
- **Auto Port Detection**: Automatic detection of Qualcomm 9008 EDL port
